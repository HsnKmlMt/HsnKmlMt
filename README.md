<h1 align="left">Hello There! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

###

<p align="left">âœ¨ My name is Hasan and I'm a backend developer passionate about building scalable and maintainable systems. I follow clean code practices and SOLID principles because while machines can run any code, writing for humans is what makes great engineering. I'm always exploring new tools, architectures, and best practices to stay in sync with the evolving tech world.
